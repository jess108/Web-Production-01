		Over the last several weeks, the coronavirus pandemic has forced the government to shut down all non-essential operations and mandate that the public stays home to help flatten the curve of the spread. In this time of quarantine, I have been released from my job in the restaurant industry and had my classes transition to a distance learning protocol. Most days I spend at home but every once in a while I venture out into society to take a look around and see what’s happening.

		For my final project, a photo gallery documenting my home life, I decided to document the economic shut down that my neighborhood in Woodside Queens, including the surrounding areas of Jackson Heights, Sunnyside and Long Island City, are enduring during this time. Above is a self portrait of myself wearing my face mask as I embark on a photo walk exploring the neighborhood. On my walks I’ve encountered empty parks, shuttered store fronts, pedestrians wearing their personal protective equipment, COVID-19 graffiti, and messages of hope and resilience from the community.

		In the midst of this pandemic, it feels as if time is standing still and the light at the end of the tunnel is still nowhere in sight, but I am confident that eventually we will get through this crisis as a society and regain a sense of community and unity. I look forward to the day when many of these shuttered businesses will reopen, the city streets will come back to life and we will no longer live in fear of contracting or spreading a deadly infection.
