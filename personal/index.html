		This webpage is designed to serve as a bit of a portfolio to showcase some of the work that I have done throughout my time as a Media Studies student working towards my Bachelor's degree at Hunter College, and also any future projects I might embark on, or get hired to perform, that I feel are examples of what I am learning and creating. This page is a constant work in progress, as I continue to learn and develop my skills as an artist, a web designer and developer.
