	<h1>DEPTH OF FIELD</h1>

	<h6>Photoshop Depth of Field</h6>

<p>
	This piano seemed to me like the perfect object to create a compelling image of shallow depth of field. My class mate Aminata did a beautiful job framing the shot to capture a long row of piano keys, but the original shot had all of the keys relatively in focus, especially in the center of the row. I used the Field Blur tool to place about 30% blur in the center of the row and about a 50% blur towards the end to create the effect of shallow depth of field in Photoshop because I wanted to emphasize the length of the piano by blurring the keys in the distance.

	For the in-camera depth of field excercise, I was excited to come across these lockers in the hallway. Looks to me like the perfect subject to stage a shot such as this. The aperature is at f/4 with the shutter speed at 1/250s. The ISO was 1600. I didn't do too much editing to this photo. I brightened the exposure +0.30, touched up the highlights and the blacks about +10 to bring up the contrast, then I increased the vibrance and saturation around +40 in order to warm up the wood of the lockers.

<h1>RESIZING IMAGES</h1>

			<h6>The 1920 X 1080 px Image</h6>

				</center>
			</figure>

			

			<p>
				
				Using Photoshop, I simply changed the size of the image file to 1920 px, which automatically adjusted the height to about 1080 and the resolution to 300 ppi. When I uploaded it to my web page, however, the image was entirely too big to look at so I adjusted the width and height to 960 X 540 in order for the image to fit properly onto the screen.

			<h6>The 5 X 7 Image</h6>

					<figcaption>Aquafina and the Rule of Thirds</figcaption>

				</center>
			</figure>

			

			<p>
				For the second image in the assignment, I took the original image before I resized it for the first web page of the 1920 X 1080 image and I not only cropped the image in order to make Aquafina adhere to the Rule of Thirds, I also resized the image from the menu in order to get the inches down to 5 X 7, making sure that the ppi was set to 72 ppi as the assignment instructed us to do. 

			</p>

<h6>The Thumbnail Image</h6>

			<p>
				Last but not least, for the final image in the assignment, I cropped the original image again to make it square, then I went back into the menu to resize the image to the size of a Thumbnail at 160 X 160 pixels at 72 ppi. I gave Aquafina a tiny bit of lead room in the direction that he was gazing instead of placing him directly in the center of the frame.
