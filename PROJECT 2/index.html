<h1>What can I do to drive away</h1>

<p>
		What can I do to drive away
	<br>Remembrance from my eyes? for they have seen,
	<br>Aye, an hour ago, my brilliant queen!
	<br>Touch has a memory. O say, Love, say,
	<br>What can I do to kill it and be free
	<br>In my old liberty?
	<br>When every fair one that I saw was fair,
	<br>Enough to catch me in but half a snare,
	<br>Not keep me there
	<br>My muse had wings,
	<br>And ever ready was to take her course
	<br>Whither I bent her force,
	<br>Unintellectual, yet divine to me: --
	<br>Divine, I say! -- What sea-bird o'er the sea
	<br>Is a philosopher the while he goes
	<br>Winging along where the great water throes?
	<br>How shall I do
	<br>To get anew
	<br>Those moulted feathers, and so mount once more
	<br>Above, above
	<br>The reach of fluttering Love,
	<br>And make him cower lowly while I soar?
	<br>Shall I gulp wine? No, that is vulgarism,
	<br>A heresy and schism,
	<br>Foisted into the cannon law of love; --
	<br>No, -- wine is only sweet to happy men;
	<br>More dismal cares
	<br>Seize on me unawares, --
	<br>Where shall I learn to get my peace again?
	<br>To banish thoughts of that most hateful land,
	<br>Dungeoner of my friends, that wicked strand
	<br>That monstrous region, whose dull rivers pour,
	<br>Ever from their sordid urns unto the shore,
	<br>Unown'd of any weedy-haired gods;
	<br>Whose rank-grown forests, frosted, black, and blind,
	<br>Would fright a Dryad; whose harsh herbag'd meads
	<br>Make lean and lank the starv'd ox while he feeds;
	<br>There bad flowers have no scent, birds no sweet song,
	<br>And great unerring nature once seems wrong.
	<br>O, for some sunny spell
	<br>To dissipate the shadows of this hell!
	<br>Say they are gone, -- with the new dawning light
	<br>Steps forth my lady bright!
	<br>O, let me once more rest
	<br>My soul upon that dazzling breast!
	<br>Let me once again these aching arms be plac'd,
	<br>The tender gaolers of thy waist!
	<br>And let me feel that warm breath here and there
	<br>To spread a rapture in my very hair, --
	<br>O, the sweetness of the pain!
	<br>Give me those lips again!
	<br>To dream of thee!

	<h2>John Keats</h2>
